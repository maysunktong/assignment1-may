          <h2>The Witcher</h2>
          <p>
            This game released in May 2015 and in my opinion it still
            beats many high quality games of today. I and Roach walked around village and see stuff is such a relaxation. This game has a good storytelling and interesting quests. It is so captivating without even trying to like
            it and I recommend everyone to buy a copy. I heard they are making a new one too.

          <h2>Pewdiepie</h2>
          <p>
            PewDiePie or Felix has a special place in my heart because of his
            creative content and laughs since I was 19 in college.
            Alongside his main channel, I also followed Marzia, his girlfriend
            now wife, and life of their pet pugs. I remembered I leave his
            videos in a background playing while doing more important work. I
            believe many of his fans feel that we grew up with him. Now, Felix and Marzia are married and has a son named Bj√∂rn. They
            live in Japan.
